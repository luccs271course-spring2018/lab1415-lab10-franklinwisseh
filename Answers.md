1.) Discuss the differences among the results. Does the starting point make a difference?

  *Each Iterator creates a unique output for each starting point indicating that the starting point does make a difference. 
  
  *Random walk iterator will revisit multiple states since it is at random. 
  
  *Breadth and Closest seem to act the same from observations. 
  
  *Depth tends to print the reverse of the previous two iterators.
  
  
2.) Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.

  *A real-world map might require more than four colors if more than one country has multiple disconnected regions
  
  *A real-world map might have more than 4 perimeters to be represented on the map.
